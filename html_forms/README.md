<h2 align="left">Project Objectives</h2>
<p align="left">In this project, I wrote my code in purely JaveScript. At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:<br>

- Create an HTML form for a basic contact form with the following requirements:

Include fields for the userâ€™s name, email address, and message.
Apply appropriate HTML5 validation attributes to ensure the name and email fields are required and that the email field accepts a valid email format.
Use a textarea element for the message field to allow for a long description and not limit it to just one line.
Add a submit button to submit the form.
- Design an HTML registration form with the following specifications:

Include fields for the userâ€™s name, email, password, and confirm password.
Implement HTML5 validation attributes to ensure all fields are required,
And the email field accepts a valid email format, and the password fields match.
Use appropriate input types (e.g., email, password) and labels for each field.
- Build an HTML form for a subscription with the following criteria:

Include fields for the userâ€™s name, email, and subscription preference (monthly, yearly).
Utilize radio buttons for the subscription preference and ensure that the user can only select one option.
Apply HTML5 validation to ensure all fields are required and the email field accepts a valid email format.
- Develop an HTML feedback form with checkboxes to capture user opinions and the ability to upload a file:

Include fields for the userâ€™s name, email, checkboxes for various feedback options (e.g., excellent, good, average, poor), and a file upload field.
Ensure that the user can select multiple checkboxes.
Specify the file upload field using the <input type="file"> element.
Implement HTML5 validation to ensure the name, email, at least one checkbox, and a file are filled out.
- Design an HTML survey form with a select dropdown to collect user preferences, along with time and date selection:

Include fields for the userâ€™s name, email, a select dropdown for their favorite color (options: red, blue, green), and separate fields for time and date selection.
Apply HTML5 validation to ensure all fields are required, including the select dropdown, time, and date fields.

To implement the time and date selection, use the following input types:

For time: input type="time"

For date: input type="date"
